# Data Preprocessing for Deep Learning models
## Batch Normalization Demonstration

A practical PyTorch implementation to visualize how **Batch Normalization (BN)** stabilizes internal covariate shift in deep learning models.

### 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world financial dataset (Credit Scoring) to demonstrate the mathematical impact of BN. We process a mini-batch of 5 samples with 3 distinct features:
- **Feature 1:** Annual Income
- **Feature 2:** Credit History Length
- **Feature 3:** Debt Ratio

### 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed. After that, pulling *Batchnorm.py*.
2. **Install PyTorch**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
3. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python Batchnorm.py
